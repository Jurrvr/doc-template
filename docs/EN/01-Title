Background & Need

Due to shortages, we have assembled a team from the UW Hospital, UW Makerspace, Delve and Midwest Prototyping to design a medical face shield shown in the images above. The design is based on shields currently used in hospitals (here) using very economic materials and scalable, advanced manufacturing processes.

Our aim is to post on our website:

1. Open Source Design: We’ve posted the open-source design and parts list here and will update the design as we receive feedback and complete further testing. The blog post from Delve is here. See legal disclaimer at the bottom of this page. If you would like to make shields yourself, please see the “Manufacturing Resources” sections below.

2.Supplier Resources: A list of suppliers for plastic, foam and elastic. If you are a supplier or looking for suppliers, please see the “Supplier Resources” section below.

3. Buyer Resources: A list of manufacturers and their expected production rates for making face shields. If you are looking for manufacturers selling face shields, please see the “Buyer Resources” section below. Note: We encourage you to pursue multiple sources since the supply of PPE is still very limited.

4. E-mail List: An email list with healthcare facilities looking for face shields so we can notify them if we become aware of any developments. If interested, please fill out the intake form below.
